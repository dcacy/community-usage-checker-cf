# community-usage-checker-cf

This app will show you the Communities available to you in Connections Cloud. It uses OAuth to Connections Cloud so you'll see the Communities available to you -- including the restricted ones.

It uses IBM Cloud Functions for the heavy lifting of getting the data from Connections Cloud, so all you need is this set of files and an HTTP server to run it on.  See it in action here: [https://dcacy.github.io/community-usage-checker-cf/](https://dcacy.github.io/connections-user-checker-cf/).
