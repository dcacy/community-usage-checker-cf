# dpc-community-usage-checker


This app will show you the Communities available to you in IBM Connections Cloud. It uses OAuth to Connections Cloud so you'll see the Communities available to you -- including the restricted ones.

It uses IBM Cloud Functions for the heavy lifting of getting the data from Connections Cloud, so all you need is this set of files and an HTTP server to run it on. 

The app is configured for the demonstration <strong>Showcase Org</strong> on Connections Cloud. If you have 
an account in that org, see the app in action here: [https://dcacy.github.io/community-usage-checker-cf/index.html](https://dcacy.github.io/community-usage-checker-cf/index.html).
